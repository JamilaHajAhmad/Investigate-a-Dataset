## Project Overview
This project investigates the **Medical Appointment No Shows** dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can inform decision-making in [related field or context, e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.]. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The source of the dataset is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of **110.527** medical appointments with its **14** associated variables (characteristics). It includes the following key columns:<br>

## Objective
The primary goal of this investigation is to figure out the factors that most contribute to not showing up to a medical appointment.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Took the dataset CSV file from Kaggle platform.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Renaming columns, optimizing the datatype of columns for effective memory consumption,<br>
removing some unnecessary columns, ...
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: visualizations and summary statistics
4. **Conclusion**: Addressing the key findings and limitations

## Key Findings
1. The dataset contains approximately 20.2% no-shows.<br>
2. The average age of patients who did not show up to their appointments is slightly younger than the average age of patients who did show up.<br>
3. Females are more likely to not show up to their appointments than males.<br>
4. Receiving messages affects the no-show status.<br>
5. The neighborhood with the highest percentage of no-shows is 'JARDIM CAMBURI ', with approximately 6.6% of no-shows.<br>
6. The second highest percentage of no-shows is 'MARIA ORTIZL', with approximately 5.5% of no-shows.<br>
7. The third highest percentage of no-shows is 'ITARAR√â', with approximately 4% of no-shows.<br>
8. The dataset is clean and optimized for memory allocation, with most columns converted to boolean and the datatype of 'age' optimized to 'int8'.<br>
9. The dataset can be used to answer the questions posed earlier, and the relationships between different variables and no-show status can be visualized using plots.
